    "text": "See The Birds Are Coming is a concept album, a musical poem about the bird flight, which presents surprising soundscapes and textures of emotional density in surprising arrangements. Before the spiritual eye of the listener are images of Scandinavian landscapes, of sea, clouds and migratory birds. A music of magical fascination and great beauty develops from original compositions and processed tradition."
